                <p>Bitcoin is an illusion, a mass hallucination, so one hears. It’s just numbers in cyberspace, a
                    mirage,
                    insubstantial as a soap bubble. Bitcoin is not backed by anything other than the faith of the fools
                    who buy
                    it and of the greater fools who buy it from these lesser fools. And you know? Fair enough. All this
                    is true.
                    What may be less easy to grasp is that U.S. dollars are likewise an illusion. They too consist
                    mainly of
                    numbers out there in cyberspace. Sometimes they’re stored in paper or coins, but while the paper and
                    coins
                    are material, the dollars they represent are not. U.S. dollars are not backed by anything other than
                    the
                    faith of the fools who accept it as payment and of other fools who agree in turn to accept it as
                    payment
                    from them. The main difference is that, for the moment at least, the illusion, in the case of
                    dollars, is
                    more widely and more fiercely believed. In fact, almost all of our U.S. dollars, about 90 percent,
                    are
                    purely abstract — they literally do not exist in any tangible form. James Surowiecki reported in
                    2012 that
                    “only about 10 percent of the U.S. money supply — about $1 trillion of the roughly $10 trillion
                    total —
                    exists in the form of paper cash and coins.” (The number now appears to be about $1.5 trillion out
                    of $13.7
                    trillion.) There is nothing stopping our banking system from creating more dollars whenever the mood
                    strikes. Of the $13.7 trillion in the M2 money supply as of October 2017, $13.5 trillion was created
                    after
                    1959—or, to put it another way, M2 has expanded by almost 50 times. The U.S. dollar is what is known
                    as a
                    “fiat” currency. Fiat is Latin for “let there be,” as in fiat lux, let there be light; hence, fiat
                    denarii,
                    let there be lire, bolivars, dollars, and rubles. The temptation for leaders of nation-states to
                    manufacture
                    money has historically been practically irresistible. One evident result of this wantonness is
                    inflation:
                    The purchasing power of $1 in 1959 is now a little under 12 cents. </p>
